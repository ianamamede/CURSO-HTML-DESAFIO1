    <h2 id="tools">What tools to use: Sugestions</h2>
    <small><a href="#start">(voltar)</a></small>
    <p>The two best tools for <mark>HTML</mark> are Visual Studio Code and Chrome. </p>
    <p>Visual Studio Code is a versatile text editor with powerful features like syntax highlighting and extensions, aiding in coding. </p>
    <p>Chrome, as a browser, offers robust developer tools accessible via right-click > Inspect. It allows real-time previews and debugging, immensely helpful for testing HTML code. </p>
    <p>Together, they form a dynamic duo for HTML: Visual Studio Code for writing and editing code, while Chrome provides a live environment for testing and fine-tuning websites. </p>
    <p><del>Of course, this is a <strong> matter of choice</strong>, and you can choose what best <em>suits</em> you.</del></p>
    
    <h2 id="elements">What is the "Elements Inspector"</h2>
    <small><a href="#start">(voltar)</a></small>
    <p>When you visit a webpage, it is the tool that helps show how that page was built and how it works.</p>
    <p>The Elements Inspector is like a map that shows all the details of an webpage, how it was built, step by step, showing the website's structure.</p>
    <p>It shows how images are placed, how text is organised, which parts are clickable buttons, and even how colours and sizes are chosen. </p>
    <p>To access the elements inspector all you need to do is right-click anywhere on a web page and select "Inspect" or "Inspect element," it opens a little window with lots of code and information. It is like seeing the "skeleton" of that page, showing the bits of code that make it look good and work well.</p>
    <p>So, the Elements Inspector is a really cool tool to learn how websites are made and it is a good help for those who are learning how to code.</p>
    
    <h2 id="structure">Clarifying the basic structure of HTML</h2>
    <small><a href="#start">(voltar)</a></small>
    <p>HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language. Imagine it as the skeleton of a webpage.</p>
    <p>At the core, an HTML document has a few key parts. The first is the !DOCTYPE html (It must be inside <>) declaration, which tells the browser that the document is written in HTML5, the latest version of HTML.</p>
    <p>After that, there is the "html" (It must be inside <>) element, which acts as the container for the entire HTML document. Inside the "html" element, you'll find two main sections: the "head" (It must be inside <>) and the "body" (It must be inside <>).</p>
    <p>The "head"(It must be inside <>) section contains information about the document, like the page's title, links to stylesheets (CSS), and other meta-information that isn't directly displayed on the page. It's like the brains of the webpage, but users cannot see on the webpage.</p>
    <p>The "body"(It must be inside <>) section holds all the content you see on the actual webpage, like text, images, videos, links, and more. It is the part of the webpage that users interact with.</p>
    <p>Within the "body", content is structured using various elements, such as headings "h1" (Every tag must be inside <>), paragraphs "p", lists "ul" or "ol", and more. Each element has its specific purpose and helps organize and display information in different ways.</p>
    <p>Tags are used to define these elements. They often come in pairs: an opening tag ("tag") and a closing tag (/tag>), with the content placed between them. For example, "p"(It must be inside <>) starts a paragraph, and /p (It must be inside <>) ends it.</p>
    <p>HTML is all about structuring content, making it accessible and understandable for both browsers and users. It's the foundation that allows web designers and developers to create stunning and functional websites.</p>

    <h2 id="tags">TAGS: What they are and their attributes</h2>
    <small><a href="#start">(voltar)</a></small>
    <p>Tags in HTML are like labels that tell the browser how to display content. They are like instructions for your web page. Each tag serves a specific purpose; for example, "h1"(It must be inside <>) is a heading tag, "p" (It must be inside <>) is for paragraphs. Tags often come in pairs, an opening <> and a closing < /> . Attributes are extra details we can add to tags, like colour, size, or links. They give tags special abilities, enhancing how content looks or behaves on the webpage.</p>
    
    <h2 id="lists">How to include lists in your document</h2>
    <small><a href="#start">(voltar)</a></small>
    <p>To create a list in HTML, you have a couple of options. You can use "ul" (It must be inside <>) for an unordered list or "ol" (It must be inside <>) for an ordered list. Inside these tags, you use "li"(It must be inside <>) for each list item. For instance:
        Unordered list:- Item 1, - Item 2 and Ordered list: 1. Item 1, 2. Item 2.</p>

    <h2 id="links">How to add links</h2>
    <small><a href="#start">(voltar)</a></small>
    <p>To insert links in HTML, use the “a”(It must be inside <>) tag with the “href” attribute. Within the “href”, put the URL you want to link to. Here's an example: (Open <> for "a") - a href="write the link here">text you want to be clickable for the link (close the "a" tag < />)</p>
